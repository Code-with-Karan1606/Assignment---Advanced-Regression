## General Information
  Business Goal
    - You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.
    - They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.
    - Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
  

## Technologies Used
- Numpy
- python
- Pandas
- Lasso and Ridge regression

## Conclusions
We will choose Lasso as its giving feature selection option also. It has removed unwanted features from model without affecting the model accuracy. Which makes are model generalized and simple and accurate.
